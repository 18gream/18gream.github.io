      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Gracie and I began my computer science journey at SNHU four years ago. This portfolio serves as the final capstone project for CS-499 and the completion of my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.</p>
    </section>

  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>
    Completing the SNHU Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to reflect on my growth, refine my professional goals, and prepare to enter the technology industry with confidence. This portfolio demonstrates not just technical skills, but a full range of capabilities essential to modern software development — from collaboration and communication to secure coding and effective design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the program, I’ve engaged in hands-on projects that challenged me to implement secure database systems, design scalable algorithms, and write maintainable code in professional development environments. These experiences helped shape my interest in full-stack development and reinforced my passion for building software that solves real-world problems.
  </p>

  <h3>Team Collaboration & Stakeholder Communication</h3>
  <p>
    Many projects in this program required group collaboration, such as developing shared software components and participating in peer reviews. These experiences helped me understand the importance of version control, agile practices, and clear communication with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. For instance, in CS-310, I led a team project where we implemented feature requests from a mock client — a valuable experience in translating business needs into functional code.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Expertise</h3>
  <p>
    My coursework allowed me to build strong foundational skills in key areas of computer science:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Structures & Algorithms:</strong> I used advanced sorting, searching, and recursive techniques to build efficient programs and analyze their performance.</li>
      <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> I practiced modular design, implemented test-driven development (TDD), and applied design patterns to build scalable applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Databases:</strong> I designed and implemented relational databases using SQL, and later experimented with NoSQL systems like MongoDB. I also integrated front-end applications with secure back-end data access.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> I consistently applied secure coding practices to protect data and prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or data leakage.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>How the Artifacts Work Together</h3>
  <p>
    The artifacts presented in this portfolio represent key pillars of my computer science education:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Artifact 1 – Software Design and Engineering:</strong> Showcases modular design, clean code practices, and functional enhancements to a real-world scheduling application.</li>
      <li><strong>Artifact 2 – Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> Demonstrates performance optimization through algorithmic improvements and better use of data structures.</li>
      <li><strong>Artifact 3 – Databases:</strong> Highlights secure CRUD operations, data modeling, and seamless database integration in a web application.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, these projects showcase my range as a developer and my readiness to take on industry challenges. I look forward to continuing to learn, contribute to dynamic teams, and create software that makes a meaningful impact.
