      <li><strong>Security:</strong> I consistently applied secure coding practices to protect data and prevent vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or data leakage.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>How the Artifacts Work Together</h3>
  <p>

      <h2>Enhancement One: Software Design & Engineering</h2>
      <p>This artifact was previously designed in CS-360. The application is designed to track weight, modify entries, and receive notifications. The artifact was selected for this category because it showcases design and development aspects to applications. </p>
       <p>Project repo: <a href="https://github.com/18gream/artifact1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artifact1 GitHub Repository</a></p>

      <h3>Reflection Narrative</h3>
      <p>This artifact demonstrates software development and engineering skills across multiple areas. These include user account management by creating and logging in using SQLite, data storage and retrieval using database helpers, SMS notifications, and permission handling through Android APIs. The artifact was enhanced in various ways. To start, the login and registration page was enhanced through adding proper validation and feedback for user credentials. Elements were added to ensure duplicate username and passwords were prevented by checking the database before inserting. Last, findViewById was not matching XML ID, therefore that was updated too. Next, the layout files were cleaned up to align with proper UI elements (ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout). Issues with incorrect and missing IDs like editWeight and editDate were solved. Enabling of updating weight entries was adding by using dialog in RecyclerView adapter as well. For the weight entry functionality, I connected the weight entry system with the local database and included addWeightData, updateWeightData and deleteWeightData with UI refresh. There originally was no dialog field to add weight data, so that was added in the DatabaseHelper. I also included deletion and editing of weight entries through dialogs. For the SMS notifications, I fixed logic where the message sending did not align with user input regarding the phone number. There was a resource linking failed error due to improper XML attributes, which was resolved. I added clear and concise comments within the code as some did not have any comments at all. 
	Overall, I believe I met the course outcomes that I planned to meet with the first enhancement. I improved the code maintainability and quality, used engineering best practices and used modern tools and libraries. I also implemented CRUD operations by allowing users to add, update and delete entries. I also improved the input validation. I do not have any updates to my outcome coverage plan at this time. 
	During the enhancement, I learned more about debugging and how to fix improper XML and Java connections. I enhanced my understanding about working with Android’s permission system and how it affects runtime behavior. I increased my knowledge of UI responses and how different emulators or devices behave differently. Some challenges I faced were improper attributes and missing references causing the error “resource linking failed.” I also faced emulator performance issues causing lags and crashes. I dealt with crashes that were caused by XML resources and views that were not declared right. Lastly, consistency across layout files and Java code was not there, and issues with ensuring consistency occurred.

      <p>The artifact for this category is from CS-405. The artifact showcases an encryption coding assignment that demonstrates the ability to use algorithmic principles through XOR encryption, handling of input and output structures, and security practices.</p>
     <p>Project repo: <a href="https://github.com/18gream/artifact2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artifact2 GitHub Repository</a></p>

      <h3>Reflection Narrative</h3>
      <p>I selected this artifact to include in my portfolio because it demonstrates my skills in incorporating algorithms and managing data structures. The artifact showcases my understanding of algorithmic designs and security principles with encryption and decryption logic. I enhanced my artifact by including a user interface to increase interaction. I also added input validation to verify file accessibility before it is processed, and incorporated error messages to explain to users if there is an issue. I refactored the code by including better comments throughout it and restructured it to improve maintainability. 
	The enhancements made to this artifact align with course outcomes of designing and evaluating computing solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science practices. I demonstrated my ability to balance trade-offs and improve usability while keeping in mind the encryption algorithm. 
	While enhancing this artifact, I learned lessons in file input and output handling and the importance of making sure any unanticipated errors provide messages to users. A challenge I faced during enhancement of the artifact was ensuring the program located the input file correctly.

      <p><a href="https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName" target="_blank">View Full Repository on GitHub</a></p>

      <h3>Reflection Narrative</h3>
      <p>The goal of my enhancement was to improve the database capabilities and usability. I wanted to implement more advanced queries like intake condition and adoption status. I wanted to remove the fields sex_upon_outcomes, age_upon_outcome_in_weeks, and outcome_type. I planned to implement error handling and add clear filters for users to interact with. I also needed to create a .py file, as my original one was missing. All of these were successfully implemented. I selected this artifact because it demonstrates my ability to work with a database and develop applications that involve frontend visualization and backend management. 
	I successfully met the course outcomes I was planning to, specifically number 3 and 4. The enhancements to this artifact reinforced my skills in database querying and UI development. At this time, I do not have any updates to my outcome coverage plans. 
	As I was enhancing this artifact, I learned the importance of error handling and querying. Modifying the artifact so that it provided better usability and clearer user experience was challenging yet valuable.  A difficulty I faced was ensuring the Dash callbacks updated all the components without lag. I also had trouble connecting with the database at first and ensuring that I had all the necessary downloads to complete the artifact. Overall, this project deepened my knowledge in database integration.
